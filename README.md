# IoC Example Project

This is an example project I have created for a potential employer using IoC, ASP.Net/MVC & NUnit for testing.

This is my first attempt at all 3 of these technologies so I am sure there are better ways to do things.
I also suspect that the ASP.Net/MVC side of things is missing the point as I don't see any real interaction
going on between ASP.Net & the IoC containers.

I will come back (if permitted) and make this 100% correct once, until then use and follow at your own risk!
